# GoblinGame
Goblinville is a project that I made in school. It was the beginnings of testing Unity's possibilities.
This project had 1 month time and I was using Unity for 2 months at this point.
The objective is building a city and defending it at the same time from enemy goblins.
It will not get any Updates, because it was a test project.
